#+TITLE: Tagger, a nim library to write markup tags

Writing some simple xml:

#+begin_src nim
import tagger/tagMacro

createTag contacts
createTag contact, closed = false

let myContacts = contacts:
  contact:
    name = "Tony"
    phone = "654435435"
  contact:
    name = "Spammer"
    phone = "654435436"

echo myContacts
#+end_src

Gives us:

#+begin_src xml
<contacts>
  <contact name="Tony" phone="654435435"/>
  <contact name="Spammer" phone="654435436"/>
</contacts>
#+end_src

Note: actually writes an obfuscated version (no indentation nor
newlines).

Note: when defining tag parameters, you may want to write a paramater
which happens to be a reserved keyword, like =type= or =method=, in
those cases you just need to surround it with =""=, so
="type" = "text"=.
